# Linux-SDL
Linux SDL
Install SDL 1.2 on your Linux box with SCONS
should not have to do anything else except run scons to compile it.
there is a Gameexe there you can run. 


Use the Shooter v2.4.8 code. It's much more up to date.

This was something I was working on, still would like to just have no time.
Enjoy
